## Install Homebrew

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

---

## Download this project

Use OS git version or unzip:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/rvantonisse/fed-mac-setup.git

    cd fed-mac-setup
```

Commands run from now on asume you are inside `fed-mac-setup/` directory.

---

## Install software with Homebrew
Install using the Brewfile:

```shell
    brew bundle
```

This will tap `Homebrew/bundle` and install everything listed inside the `Brewfile`.

---

## Setup shell profile

copy shell profile:

```shell
    cp ./shell-setup/shell_profile.sh ~/.shell_profile

    cp ./shell-setup/shell_prompt.sh ~/shell_prompt.sh
```

Or alternatively **zsh** profile:

```shell
  cp ./zsh-setup/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

The brewfile installed the cli plugin Powerlevel10k which gives a nice interface for zsh.
